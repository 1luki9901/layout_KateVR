## Checklist for preparing a portfolio project for HR review

1. Don’t forget to add a title for the whole web page (it could be the name of your landing)
2. A landing page is implemented strictly according to the design in Figma
4. Links in the header and footer menus should lead to the corresponding blocks of the landing page
5. The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
6. Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter, and if there is a validation of the form, then it is clear in what format to enter the phone number
7. Make sure everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
8. Add favicon
9. Add a smooth scroll for the whole page
10. When you try to send the form there is no 405 error and the form is automatically cleared after submit and is scrolled to the top of the page or the page is reloaded
11. The video should work. If it is not working, it can confuse the recruiter/user, because then it is not clear why it is on the landing page.
12. The Next button is active and clickable and leads to the next block
13. “Buy now” buttons are active and clickable and lead to the contact form
14. The form shouldn’t submit empty
15. The form shouldn’t accept incorrect data in a field with a phone number (for example, a number with a letter and there was no error), give this and all inputs a correct input type
